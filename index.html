    <h2>BIOGRAPHY</h2>
    <p>
      My name is Mary Williams, I'm a dynamic and dedicated professional with a
      strong background in customer service and virtual assistance. With over
      three years of experience in email management, phone support, data entry,
      calendar management, travel planning, and client relations, I have built a
      reputation for efficiency, problem-solving, and delivering excellent
      customer experiences. Currently, I am expanding my expertise by diving
      into the world of technology, focusing on Frontend Engineering and Quality
      Assurance Testing.
    </p>
    <p>
      I thrive on learning, problem-solving, and making meaningful
      contributions. Whether in customer service, tech, or communications, I am
      committed to excellence, continuous improvement, and exceeding
      expectations.
    </p>

    <h2>THE BIG WHY: Why I Joined ALT School Software Engineering Program?</h2>
    <p>
      From the moment I discovered the world of technology, I knew I wanted to
      be a part of it. With a background in customer service and virtual
      assistance, I had spent years solving problems and making clients' lives
      easier. But deep down, I needed something more: something that would
      challenge my creativity, sharpen my problem-solving skills, and open doors
      to exciting opportunities.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thatâ€™s when I found Frontend Engineering. The idea of building interactive
      websites, creating seamless user experiences, and bringing designs to life
      sparked my curiosity. Enrolling in ALT School Africa was the perfect step.
      Here, I could gain hands-on experience and connect with like-minded
      individuals who shared my passion for technology. I saw it as more than
      just a learning journey, but a transformation, a way to break into the
      tech industry and build a future where I can create impactful web
      applications.
